Description: Data sets and functions to support the books "Statistics: Data 
        analysis and modelling" by Speekenbrink, M. (2021) 
        <https://mspeekenbrink.github.io/sdam-book/> and "An R companion to 
        Statistics: data analysis and modelling" by Speekenbrink, M. (2021) 
        <https://mspeekenbrink.github.io/sdam-r-companion/>. All datasets 
        analysed in these books are provided in this package. In addition, the 
        package provides functions to compute sample statistics (variance, 
        standard deviation, mode), create raincloud and enhanced Q-Q plots, and 
        expand Anova results into omnibus tests and tests of individual 
        contrasts.
